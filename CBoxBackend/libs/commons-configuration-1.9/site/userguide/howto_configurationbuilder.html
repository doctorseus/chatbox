	<div class="section"><h2>Using DefaultConfigurationBuilder<a name="Using_DefaultConfigurationBuilder"></a></h2>
    <p>
      This section explains how a
      <tt><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/DefaultConfigurationBuilder.html">
      DefaultConfigurationBuilder</a></tt>object is setup that provides
      access to a collection of different configuration sources.
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> is the option of choice for
      applications that have to deal with multiple configuration sources. It
      provides the following features:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Various configuration sources can be combined to a single
        <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html#Combined_Configuration">
        CombinedConfiguration</a> object. This is a truly hierarchical
        configuration supporting enhanced query facilities.</li>
        <li>As configuration sources the most relevant <tt>Configuration</tt>
        implementations provided by this library are supported. Sources are
        defined as <a href="howto_beans.html#Declaring_and_Creating_Beans">bean
        declarations</a>, so complex initializations are possible.</li>
        <li>Meta data can be provided to fine-tune the constructed
        configuration.</li>
        <li><tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> is extensible. Custom
        configuration sources can be added.</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      This document starts with some explanations of
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> basics. Then the <i>configuration
      definition files</i> processed by <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      are discussed in detail. Finally an advanced example is presented.
    </p>

    <div class="section"><h3>The configuration definition file<a name="The_configuration_definition_file"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In previous chapters we have already seen how specific configuration
      classes like <tt>PropertiesConfiguration</tt> or
      <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> can be used to load configuration data from
      a single source. This may be sufficient for small applications, but if
      requirements for configuration become more complex, additional support
      for managing a set of different configuration sources is desired. This is
      the domain of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> which allows
      combining multiple configuration sources. The properties defined in these
      sources can then be accessed as if they were defined in a single
      configuration file. The sources to be loaded have to be defined in a
      XML document with a specific structure, a so-called <i>configuration
      definition file</i>. The following listing shows a simple example of such
      a definition file:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;usergui.properties&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      A configuration definition file can contain an arbitrary number of
      elements declaring the configuration sources to load. The
      <tt>&lt;properties&gt;</tt> element is one of these; it is used to
      include properties files. For this example we store the definition file
      in the same directory as the properties file and call it
      <tt>config.xml</tt>. The properties file used in this example is the
      same as in the section about <a href="howto_properties.html">properties
      files</a>.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h3>Setting up a DefaultConfigurationBuilder<a name="Setting_up_a_DefaultConfigurationBuilder"></a></h3>
    <p>
      Now we have to create a <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> object
      and let it read this definition file. This is quite simple: Just create a
      new instance and set the name of the definition file
      (<tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> is derived from
      <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt>, so all options for specifying the document
      to load are available here, too). The combined configuration collecting
      all sources defined in the configuration definition file can then be
      obtained by calling the <tt>getConfiguration()</tt> method:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultConfigurationBuilder builder = new DefaultConfigurationBuilder();
builder.setFile(new File(&quot;config.xml&quot;));
Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration(true);
</pre></div>
    <p>
      Now the <i>config</i> object can be accessed in the usual way to query
      configuration properties, e.g. by using methods like <tt>getString()</tt>,
      or <tt>getInt()</tt>. We will see in a moment how properties defined
      in different configuration sources are accessed.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h3>Overriding properties<a name="Overriding_properties"></a></h3>
    <p>
      Using <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> to collect configuration
      sources does not make much sense if there is only a single source to be
      loaded. So let's add another one! This time we will embedd a XML file:
      <i>gui.xml</i> which is shown in the next listing:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;gui-definition&gt;
  &lt;colors&gt;
    &lt;background&gt;#808080&lt;/background&gt;
    &lt;text&gt;#000000&lt;/text&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;#008000&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;link normal=&quot;#000080&quot; visited=&quot;#800080&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/colors&gt;
  &lt;rowsPerPage&gt;15&lt;/rowsPerPage&gt;
&lt;/gui-definition&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      To make this XML document part of our global configuration we	have to
      modify our configuration definition file to also include the new file. For
      XML documents the element <tt>&lt;xml&gt;</tt> can be used so that we
      ave now:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;usergui.properties&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;xml fileName=&quot;gui.xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      The code for setting up the <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      object remains the same. From the <tt>Configuration</tt> object
      returned by the factory the new properties can be accessed in the usual
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one problem with this example configuration setup: The
      <tt>color.background</tt> property is defined in both the properties
      and the XML file, and - to make things worse - with different values.
      Which value will be returned by a call to <tt>getString()</tt>?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that the configuration sources are searched in the order
      they are defined in the configuration definition file. Here the properties
      file is included first, then comes the XML file. Because the
      <tt>color.background</tt> property can be found in the properties file
      the value specified there will be returned (which happens to be
      <tt>#FFFFFF</tt>).
    </p>
    <p>
      It might not be obvious why it makes sense to define the value of one and
      the same property in multiple configuration sources. But consider the
      following scenario: An application comes with a set of default properties
      and allows the user to override some or all of them. This can now easily
      be realized by saving the user's settings in one file and the default
      settings in another. Then in the configuration definition file the file
      with the user settings is included first and after that the file with the
      default values. The application code that queries these settings needs no
      be aware whether a property was overriden by the user. <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      takes care that properties defined in the first file (the user file) are
      found; other properties which the user has not changed will still be
      returned from the second file (the defaults file).
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h3>Optional configuration sources<a name="Optional_configuration_sources"></a></h3>
    <p>
      The example above with two configuration sources - one for user settings
      and one with default values - raises an interesting question: What happens
      if the user has not defined specific properties yet? Or what if a new user
      starts our application for the first time and thus no user specific
      properties exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      The default behavior of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> is to
      throw a <tt>ConfigurationException</tt> exception if one of the sources
      defined in the configuration definition file cannot be loaded. For our
      example this behavior is not desired: the properties file with specific user
      settings is not required. If it cannot be loaded, the example application
      should still work because a complete set of configuration properties is
      defined in the second file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> supports such optional configuration
      sources. For this purpose in the definition of a configuration source the
      <tt>config-optional</tt> attribute can be placed. An example of this
      is shown below:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;usersettings.properties&quot; config-optional=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;default.properties&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      In this configuration definition file the first properties file with user
      specific settings is marked as optional. This means that if it cannot be
      loaded, <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> will not throw an exception,
      but only write a warning message to its logger. Note that the
      <tt>config-optional</tt> attribute is absent for the second properties
      file. Thus it is mandatory, and the <tt>getConfiguration()</tt> method
      of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> would throw an exception if it
      could not be found.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h3>Union configuration<a name="Union_configuration"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In an earlier section about the configuration definition file for
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> it was stated that configuration
      files included first can override properties in configuraton files
      included later, and an example use case for this behaviour was given. There
      may be cases when there are other requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's continue the example with the application that somehow process
      database tables and that reads the definitions of the affected tables from
      its configuration. This example and the corresponding XML configuration
      files were introduced in the section about <a href="howto_xml.html">XMLConfiguration</a>.
      Now consider that this application grows larger and must be maintained by
      a team of developers. Each developer works on a separated set of tables.
      In such a scenario it would be problematic if the definitions for all
      tables would be kept in a single file. It can be expected that this file
      needs to be changed very often and thus can be a bottleneck for team
      development when it is nearly steadily checked out. It would be much better
      if each developer had an associated file with table definitions and all
      these information could be linked together at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> provides support for such a use case,
      too. It is possible to specify in the configuration definition file that
      from a set of configuration sources a logic union configuration is to be
      constructed. Then all properties defined in the provided sources are
      collected and can be accessed as if they had been defined in a single source.
      To demonstrate this feature let us assume that a developer of the database
      application has defined a specific XML file with a table definition named
      <tt>tasktables.xml</tt>:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;config&gt;
  &lt;table tableType=&quot;application&quot;&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;tasks&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;fields&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;taskid&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;description&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;responsibleID&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;creatorID&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;startDate&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;endDate&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/fields&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      This file defines the structure of an additional table, which should be
      added to the so far existing table definitions. To achieve this the
      configuration definition file has to be changed: A new section is added
      that contains the include elements of all configuration sources which
      are to be combined.
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!-- Configuration definition file that demonstrates the
     override and additional sections --&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;override&gt;
    &lt;properties fileName=&quot;usergui.properties&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;gui.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/override&gt;

  &lt;additional&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;tables.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;tasktables.xml&quot; config-at=&quot;tables&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/additional&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      Compared to the older versions of this file some changes have been done.
      One major difference is that the elements for including configuration
      sources are no longer direct children of the root element, but are now
      contained in either an <tt>&lt;override&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;additional&gt;</tt>
      section. The names of these sections already imply their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>override</tt> section is not strictly necessary. Elements in
      this section are treated as if they were children of the root element, i.e.
      properties in the included configuration sources override properties in
      sources included later. So the <tt>&lt;override&gt;</tt> tags could have
      been ommitted, but for the sake of clearity it is recommended to use them
      if there is also an <tt>&lt;additional&gt;</tt> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the <tt>&lt;additonal&gt;</tt> section that introduces a new behaviour.
      All configuration sources listed here are combined to a union configuration.
      In our example we have put two <tt>xml</tt> elements in this area
      that load the available files with database table definitions. The syntax
      of elements in the <tt>additional</tt> section is analogous to the
      syntax described so far. In this example the <tt>config-at</tt>
      attribute is introduced. It specifies the position in the logic union
      configuration where the included properties are to be added. Here it is set
      for the second element to the value <i>tables</i>. This is because the
      file starts with a <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> element, but to be compatible
      with the other table definition file it should be accessable under the key
      <tt>tables.table</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these modifications have been performed, the configuration obtained
      from <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> allows access to three database
      tables. A call of <tt>config.getString(&quot;tables.table(2).name&quot;);</tt>
      results in a value of <i>tasks</i>. In an analogous way it is possible
      to retrieve the fields of the third table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is also possible to override properties defined in an
      <tt>additonal</tt> section. This can be done by placing a configuration
      source in the <tt>override</tt> section that defines properties that
      are also defined in one of the sources listed in the <tt>additional</tt>
      section. The example does not make use of that. Note also that the order of
      the <tt>override</tt> and <tt>additional</tt> sections in a
      configuration definition file does not matter. Sources in an <tt>override</tt>
      section are always treated with higher priority (otherwise they could not
      override the values of other sources).
    </p>
    </div>

   <div class="section"><h3>Configuration definition file reference<a name="Configuration_definition_file_reference"></a></h3>
    <p>
      Configuration definition files are XML documents telling
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> which configuration sources to
      load and how to process them in order to create the resulting combined
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Overall structure of a configuration definition file</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      A configuration definition file for <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      can contain three sections, all of which are optional. A skeleton looks as
      follows:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration systemProperties=&quot;path to property file&quot;&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;!-- Meta data about the resulting combined configuration --&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;override&gt;
    &lt;!-- Configuration declarations with override semantics --&gt;
  &lt;/override&gt;
  &lt;additional&gt;
    &lt;!-- Configuration declarations that form a union configuration --&gt;
  &lt;/additional&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      <b>Declaring configuration sources</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>override</tt> and <tt>additional</tt> sections have already
      been introduced when the basics of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      were discussed. They contain declarations for the configuration sources to be
      embedded. For convenience reasons it is also possible to declare
      configuration sources outside these sections; they are then treated as if
      they were placed inside the <tt>override</tt> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each declaration of a configuration source is represented by an XML
      element whose name determines the type of the configuration source.
      Attributes or nested elements can be used to provide additional
      configuration options for the sources to be included (e.g. a name of a
      file to be loaded or a reloading strategy). Below is a list of all
      tags which can be used out of the box:
    </p>
    <p>
      </p><dl>
        <dt>properties</dt>
        <dd>With this element properties files can be included. The name of
        the file to load is specified using the <tt>fileName</tt>
        attribute. Which configuration class is created by this tag
        depends on the extension of the file to load: If the extension
        is &quot;.xml&quot;, a <tt>XMLPropertiesConfiguration</tt> object is
        created, which is able to process the XML properties format
        introduced in Java 5.0. Otherwise a <tt>PropertiesConfiguration</tt>
        object is created, the default reader for properties files.</dd>
        <dt>xml</dt>
        <dd>The <tt>xml</tt> element can be used to load XML configuration
        files. It also uses the <tt>fileName</tt> attribute to
        determine the name of the file to load and creates an instance
        of <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt>.</dd>
        <dt>jndi</dt>
        <dd>As the name implies, with this element JNDI resources can be
        included in the resulting configuration. Under the hood this is
        done by an instance of the <tt>JNDIConfiguration</tt>
        class. The <tt>prefix</tt> attribute can be used to
        select a subset of the JNDI tree.</dd>
        <dt>plist</dt>
        <dd>The <tt>plist</tt> element allows to embedd configuration
        files in the NeXT / OpenStep or Mac OS X format. Again the
        name of the file to load is specified through the
        <tt>fileName</tt> attribute. If a XML file is specified,
        a <tt>XMLPropertyListConfiguration</tt> object is created
        to process the file. Otherwise this task is delegated to a
        <tt>PropertyListConfiguration</tt> instance.</dd>
        <dt>system</dt>
        <dd>With this element an instance of <tt>SystemConfiguration</tt>
        is added to the resulting configuration allowing access to
        system properties. <i>Note:</i> Using this element system properties
        are directly made available. Alternatively the
        interpolation features introduced in version 1.4 (see
        <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Variable_Interpolation">
        Variable Interpolation</a> for more details) can be used for referencing
        system properties.</dd>
        <dt>configuration</dt>
        <dd>The <tt>configuration</tt> tag allows other configuration
        definition files to be included. This makes it possible to nest these
        definition files up to an arbitrary depth. In fact, this tag will
        create another <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> object,
        initialize it, and obtain the <tt>CombinedConfiguation</tt> from it.
        This combined configuration will then be added to the resulting
        combined configuration. Like all file-based configurations the
        <tt>fileName</tt> attribute can be used to specify the configuration
        definition file to be loaded. This file must be an XML document that
        conforms to the format described here. Some of the most important
        settings are copied from the original <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
        object to the newly created builder:
        <ul>
        <li>the base path under which configuration files are searched</li>
        <li>some flags, e.g. for controlling delimiter parsing or throwing
        exceptions on missing properties</li>
        <li>the logger</li>
        <li>the configuration and error listeners</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>ini</dt>
        <dd>This tag can be used to include an ini file into the resulting
        combined configuration. Behind the scenes an instance of
        <tt><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/HierarchicalINIConfiguration.html">
        HierarchicalINIConfiguration</a></tt> is used to load the ini file.</dd>
        <dt>env</dt>
        <dd>With this tag direct access to environment properties can be enabled.
        This works in the same way as the <tt>&lt;system&gt;</tt> tag for
        Java system properties.</dd>
      </dl>
    
    <p>
      In the declaration of a configuration source it is possible to set
      properties on the corresponding configuration objects. Configuration
      declarations are indeed
      <a href="howto_beans.html#Declaring_and_Creating_Beans">Bean
      declarations</a>. That means they can have attributes matching simple
      properties of the configuration object to create, and sub elements
      matching complex properties. The following example fragment shows how
      complex initialization can be performed in a configuration declaration:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;test.properties&quot; throwExceptionOnMissing=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;reloadingStrategy refreshDelay=&quot;10000&quot;
    config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration.reloading.FileChangedReloadingStrategy&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;xml fileName=&quot;test.xml&quot; delimiterParsingDisabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;expressionEngine config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration.tree.DefaultExpressionEngine&quot;
      propertyDelimiter=&quot;/&quot; indexStart=&quot;[&quot; indexEnd=&quot;]&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xml&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      In this example a configuration source for a properties file and one for
      an XML document are defined. For the properties source the
      <tt>throwExceptionOnMissing</tt> property is set to <b>true</b>,
      which means that it should throw an exception if a requested property is
      not found. In addition it is assigned a reloading strategy, which is
      declared and configured in a sub element. The XML configuration source is
      initialized in a similar way: a simple property is set, and an expression
      engine is assigned. More information about the format for declaring objects
      and initializing their properties can be found in the section about
      <a href="howto_beans.html#Declaring_and_Creating_Beans">bean
      declarations</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the attributes that correspond to properties of the
      configuration object to be created, a configuration declaration can have a
      set of special attributes that are evaluated by
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> when it creates the objects.
      These attributes are listed in the following table:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p><table class="bodyTable" border="1">
    <tr class="a">
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr class="b">
      <td valign="top"><tt>config-name</tt></td>
      <td>Allows a name to be specified for this configuration. This name can
      be used to obtain a reference to the configuration from the resulting
      combined configuration (see below).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="a">
      <td valign="top"><tt>config-at</tt></td>
      <td>With this attribute an optional prefix can be specified for the
      properties of the corresponding configuration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="b">
      <td valign="top"><tt>config-optional</tt></td>
      <td>Declares a configuration as optional. This means that errors that
      occur when creating the configuration are silently ignored. The default
      behavior when an error occurs is that no configuration is added to
      the resulting combined configuration. This behavior can be used to find
      out whether an optional configuration could be successfully created or
      not. If you specify a name for the optional configuration (using the
      <tt>config-name</tt> attribute), you can later check whether the
      combined configuration contains a configuration with this name. With the
      <tt>config-forceCreate</tt> attribute (see below) this default
      behavior can be changed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="a">
      <td valign="top"><tt>config-forceCreate</tt></td>
      <td>This boolean attribute is only evaluated for configurations declared as
      optional. It determines the behavior of the configuration builder when
      the optional configuration could not be created. If set to <b>true</b>,
      the builder tries to create an empty, uninitialized configuration of the
      correct type and add it to the resulting combined configuration. This is
      especially useful for file-based configurations. Consider a use case
      where an application wants to store user specific configuration files in
      the users' home directories. When a user starts this application for the
      first time, the user configuration does not exist yet. If it is declared
      as <i>optional</i> and <i>forceCreate</i>, the missing configuration
      file won't cause an error, but an empty configuration will be created.
      The application can then obtain this configuration, add properties to it
      (e.g. user specific settings) and save it. Without the
      <tt>config-forceCreate</tt> attribute the application would have to
      check whether the user configuration exists in the combined configuration
      and eventually create it manually. Note that not all configuration
      providers support this mechanism. Sometimes it may not be possible to
      create an empty configuration if the standard initialization fails. In
      this case no configuration will be added to the combined configuration
      (with other words: the <tt>config-forceCreate</tt> attribute will not
      have any effect).</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      <i>Note:</i> In older versions of Commons Configuration the attributes
      <tt>config-at</tt> and <tt>config-optional</tt> were named
      <tt>at</tt> and <tt>optional</tt> respective. They have been
      renamed in order to avoid possible name clashes with property names for
      configuration sources. However, for reasons of backwards compatibility,
      the old attribute names can still be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another useful feature is the built-in support for interpolation (i.e.
      variable substitution): You can use variables in your configuration
      definition file that are defined in declared configuration sources. For
      instance, if the name of a configuration file to be loaded is defined by
      the system property <tt>CONFIG_FILE</tt>, you can do something like
      this:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;!-- Load the system properties --&gt;
  &lt;system/&gt;
  &lt;!-- Now load the config file, using a system property as file name --&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;${CONFIG_FILE}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      Note that you can refer only to properties that have already been loaded.
      If you change the order of the <tt>&lt;system&gt;</tt> and the
      <tt>&lt;properties&gt;</tt> elements in the example above, an error
      will occur because the <tt>${CONFIG_FILE}</tt> variable will then be
      undefined at the moment it is evaluated.
    </p>
     <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;configuration systemProperties=&quot;systemProperties.xml&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- Load the system properties --&gt;
  &lt;system/&gt;
  &lt;!-- Now load the config file, using a system property as file name --&gt;
  &lt;properties fileName=&quot;${CONFIG_FILE}&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      This example differs from the previous one by the <tt>systemProperties</tt>
      attribute added to the root element. It causes the specified to be read
      and all properties defined therein to be added to the system properties.
      So properties like <i>CONFIG_FILE</i> can be defined in a properties
      file and are then treated as if they were system properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The header section</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the header section properties of the resulting combined configuration
      object can be set. The main part of this section is a bean declaration
      that is used for creating the resulting configuration object. Other
      elements can be used for customizing the
      <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html#Node_combiners">Node combiners</a>
      used by the override and the union combined configuration. The following
      example shows a header section that uses all supported properties:
    </p>

      The <tt>result</tt> element points to the bean declaration for the
      resulting combined configuration. In this example we set some attributes
      and initialize the node combiner (which is not necessary because the
      default override combiner is specified), and the expression engine to be
      used. Note that the <tt>config-class</tt> attribute makes it
      possible to inject custom classes for the resulting configuration or the
      node combiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <tt>combiner</tt> section allows nodes to be defined as list nodes.
      This can be necessary for certain node combiner implementations to work
      correctly. More information can be found in the section about
      <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html#Node_combiners">Node combiners</a>.

    <p>
      <i>Note:</i> From time to time the question is raised whether there is a
      document type definition or a schema defining exactly the structure of a
      configuration definition file. Frankly, the answer is no. This is due to
      the fact that the format is extensible. As will be shown below, it is
      possible to register yout own tags in order to embedd custom configuration
      sources.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h3>An example<a name="An_example"></a></h3>
    <p>
      After all that theory let's go through a more complex example! We start
      with the configuration definition file that looks like the following:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!-- Test configuration definition file that demonstrates complex initialization --&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;result delimiterParsingDisabled=&quot;true&quot; forceReloadCheck=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      &lt;expressionEngine config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration.tree.xpath.XPathExpressionEngine&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;combiner&gt;
      &lt;additional&gt;
        &lt;list-nodes&gt;
          &lt;node&gt;table&lt;/node&gt;
        &lt;/list-nodes&gt;
      &lt;/additional&gt;
    &lt;/combiner&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;override&gt;
    &lt;properties fileName=&quot;user.properties&quot; throwExceptionOnMissing=&quot;true&quot;
      config-name=&quot;properties&quot; config-optional=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      &lt;reloadingStrategy refreshDelay=&quot;10000&quot;
      config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration.reloading.FileChangedReloadingStrategy&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;settings.xml&quot; config-name=&quot;xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/override&gt;
  &lt;additional&gt;
    &lt;xml config-name=&quot;tab1&quot; fileName=&quot;table1.xml&quot; config-at=&quot;database.tables&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xml config-name=&quot;tab2&quot; fileName=&quot;table2.xml&quot; config-at=&quot;database.tables&quot;
        validating=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/additional&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      This configuration definition file includes four configuration sources and
      sets some properties for the resulting <tt>CombinedConfiguration</tt>.
      Of special interest is the <tt>forceReloadCheck</tt> property, which
      enables a special check for detecting property changes in the contained
      configuration sources. If this property is not set, reloading won't work.
      Because we have configured a reloading strategy for one of the included
      configuration sources we have to set this flag so that this reloading
      strategy can function properly. More details about this topic can be
      found in the Javadocs for
      <tt><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/CombinedConfiguration.html">
      CombinedConfiguration</a></tt>. We also set some properties for the
      configurations to be loaded; for instance we declare that one of the XML
      configurations should be validated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the following code we can create a <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      and load this file:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultConfigurationBuilder builder = new DefaultConfigurationBuilder();
builder.setFile(new File(&quot;configuration.xml&quot;));
CombinedConfiguration cc = builder.getConfiguration(true);
</pre></div>
    <p>
      It would have been possible to specify the location of the configuration
      definition file in multiple other ways, e.g. as a URL. The boolean argument
      in the call to <tt>getConfiguration()</tt> determines whether the
      configuration definition file should be loaded. For our simple example we
      want this to happen, but it would also be possible to load the file
      manually (by calling the <tt>load()</tt> method), and after that
      updating the configuration. (Remember that <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      is derived from <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt>, that means you can use all methods
      provided by this class to alter its data, e.g. to add further configuration
      sources.) If the configuration's data was manually changed, you should
      call <tt>getConfiguration()</tt> with the argument <b>false</b>.
      <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> also provides the <tt>registerEntityId()</tt>
      method that can be used to define the location of DTD files (refer to the
      section <a href="howto_xml.html#Validation_of_XML_configuration_files">
      Validation of XML configuration files</a> for more details). This method
      is available for <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>, too. The
      entities registered here will be passed to the loaded child XML
      configurations. So you can register the DTDs of all child XML configurations
      globally at the configuration builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <tt>header</tt> section we have chosen an XPATH expression
      engine for the resulting configuration. So we can query our properties
      using the convenient XPATH syntax. By providing the <tt>config-name</tt>
      attribute we have given all configuration sources a name. This name can
      be used to obtain the corresponding sources from the combined
      configuration. For configurations in the override section this is
      directly possible:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
Configuration propertiesConfig = cc.getConfiguration(&quot;properties&quot;);
Configuration xmlConfig = cc.getConfiguration(&quot;xml&quot;);
</pre></div>
    <p>
      Configurations in the <tt>additional</tt> section are treated a bit
      differently: they are all packed together in another combined configuration
      and then added to the resulting combined configuration. So in our example
      the combined configuration <tt>cc</tt> will contain three configurations:
      the two configurations from the override section, and the combined
      configuration with the <tt>additional</tt> configurations. The latter
      is stored under a name determined by the <tt>ADDITIONAL_NAME</tt>
      constant of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>. The following
      code shows how the configurations of the <tt>additional</tt> section
      can be accessed:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
CombinedConfiguration ccAdd = (CombinedConfiguration)
  cc.getConfiguration(DefaultConfigurationBuilder.ADDITIONAL_NAME);
Configuration tab1Config = ccAdd.getConfiguration(&quot;tab1&quot;);
Configuration tab2Config = ccAdd.getConfiguration(&quot;tab2&quot;);
</pre></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section"><h3>Extending the configuration definition file format<a name="Extending_the_configuration_definition_file_format"></a></h3>
    <p>
      If you have written a custom configuration class, you might want to
      declare instances of this class in a configuration definition file, too.
      With <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> this is now possible by
      registering a <i>ConfigurationProvider</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt> is an inner class defined in
      <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>. Its task is to create and
      initialize a configuration object. Whenever <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt>
      encounters a tag in the <tt>override</tt> or the <tt>additional</tt>
      section it checks whether for this tag a <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt>
      was registered. If this is the case, the provider is asked to create a
      new configuration instance; otherwise an exception will be thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for adding support for a new configuration class you have to create an
      instance of <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt> (or a derived class) and
      register it at the configuration builder using the
      <tt>addConfigurationProvider()</tt> method. This method expects the
      name of the associated tag and the provider instance as arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your custom configuration class does not need any special initialization,
      you can use the <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt> class directly. It is
      able of creating an instance of a specified class (which must be derived
      from <tt>AbstractConfiguration</tt>). Let's take a look at an example
      where we want to add support for a configuration class called
      <tt>MyConfiguration</tt>. The corresponding tag in the configuration
      definition file should have the name <tt>myconfig</tt>. The code for
      registering the new provider and loading the configuration definition file
      looks as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultConfigurationBuilder builder = new DefaultConfigurationBuilder();
DefaultConfigurationBuilder.ConfigurationProvider provider = new
  DefaultConfigurationBuilder.ConfigurationProvider(MyConfiguration.class);
builder.addConfigurationProvider(&quot;myconfig&quot;, provider);

builder.setFileName(&quot;configuration.xml&quot;);
Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
</pre></div>
    <p>
      If your configuration provider is registered this way, your configuration
      definition file can contain the <tt>myconfig</tt> tag just as any
      other tag for declaring a configuration source:
    </p>
    <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;additional&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;settings.xml&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;myconfig delimiterParsingDisabled=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/additional&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    <p>
      As is demonstrated in this example, it is possible to specify attributes
      for initializing properties of your configuration object. In this example
      we set the default <tt>delimiterParsingDisabled</tt> property
      inherited from <tt>AbstractConfiguration</tt>. Of course you can set
      custom properties of your configuration class, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your custom configuration class is a file-based configuration, you
      should use the <tt>FileConfigurationProvider</tt> class instead of
      <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt>. <tt>FileConfigurationProvider</tt>
      is another inner class of <tt>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</tt> that
      knows how to deal with file-based configurations: it ensures that the
      correct base path is set and takes care of invoking the <tt>load()</tt>
      method.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your custom configuration class requires special initialization, you
      need to create your own provider class that extends
      <tt>ConfigurationProvider</tt>. Here you will have to override the
      <tt>getConfiguration(ConfigurationDeclaration)</tt> method, which is
      responsible for creating the configuration instance (all information
      necessary for this purpose can be obtained from the passed in declaration
      object). It is recommended that you call the inherited method first,
      which will instantiate and initialize the new configuration object. Then
      you can perform your specific initialization.
