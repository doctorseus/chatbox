    		and structured XML datasets.

	<div class="section"><h2>Hierarchical properties<a name="Hierarchical_properties"></a></h2>
		<p>
            Many sources of configuration data have a hierarchical or tree-like
            nature. They can represent data that is structured in many ways.
            Such configuration sources are represented by classes derived from
            <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
            <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prominent examples of hierarchical configuration sources are XML
            documents. They can be read and written using the
            <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/XMLConfiguration.html">
            <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt></a> class. This section explains how
            to deal with such structured data and demonstrates the enhanced query
            facilities supported by <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt>. We
            use XML documents as examples for structured configuration sources,
            but the information provided here (especially the rules for accessing
            properties) applies to other hierarchical configurations as well.
            Examples for other hierarchical configuration classes are

        <div class="section"><h3>Accessing properties in hierarchical configurations<a name="Accessing_properties_in_hierarchical_configurations"></a></h3>
            <p>
                We will start with a simple XML document to show some basics
                about accessing properties. The following file named
                <tt>gui.xml</tt> is used as example document:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;gui-definition&gt;
  &lt;colors&gt;
    &lt;background&gt;#808080&lt;/background&gt;
    &lt;text&gt;#000000&lt;/text&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;#008000&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;link normal=&quot;#000080&quot; visited=&quot;#800080&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;default&gt;${colors.header}&lt;/default&gt;
  &lt;/colors&gt;
  &lt;rowsPerPage&gt;15&lt;/rowsPerPage&gt;
  &lt;buttons&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;OK,Cancel,Help&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/buttons&gt;
  &lt;numberFormat pattern=&quot;###\,###.##&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/gui-definition&gt;
</pre></div>
			<p>
				(As becomes obvious, this tutorial does not bother with good
				design of XML documents, the example file should rather 
				demonstrate the different ways of accessing properties.)
				To access the data stored in this document it must be loaded
                by <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt>. Like other 
                <a href="howto_filebased.html">file based</a>
                configuration classes <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> supports
                many ways of specifying the file to process. One way is to
                pass the file name to the constructor as shown in the following
                code fragment:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
try
{
    XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration(&quot;tables.xml&quot;);
    // do something with config
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // something went wrong, e.g. the file was not found
}
</pre></div>
			<p>
				If no exception was thrown, the properties defined in the
                XML document are now available in the configuration object.
                Other hierarchical configuration classes that operate on files
                have corresponding constructors and methods for loading their data.
                The following fragment shows how the properties can be accessed:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
String backColor = config.getString(&quot;colors.background&quot;);
String textColor = config.getString(&quot;colors.text&quot;);
String linkNormal = config.getString(&quot;colors.link[@normal]&quot;);
String defColor = config.getString(&quot;colors.default&quot;);
int rowsPerPage = config.getInt(&quot;rowsPerPage&quot;);
List&lt;Object&gt; buttons = config.getList(&quot;buttons.name&quot;);
</pre></div>
			<p>
				This listing demonstrates some important points about constructing
				keys for accessing properties in hierarchical configuration sources and about
                features of <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> in general:
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Nested elements are accessed using a dot notation. In
						the example document there is an element
						<tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt> in the body of the
						<tt>&lt;color&gt;</tt> element. The corresponding
						key is <tt>color.text</tt>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The root element is ignored when constructing keys. In
						the example you do not write
						<tt>gui-definition.color.text</tt>, but only
						<tt>color.text</tt>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Attributes of XML elements are accessed in a XPath like
						notation.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Interpolation can be used as in <tt>PropertiesConfiguration</tt>.
                        Here the <tt>&lt;default&gt;</tt> element in the
                        <tt>colors</tt> section refers to another color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lists of properties can be defined in a short form using
                        the delimiter character (which is the comma by default).
                        In this example the <tt>buttons.name</tt> property
                        has the three values <i>OK</i>, <i>Cancel</i>, and
                        <i>Help</i>, so it is queried using the <tt>getList()</tt>
                        method. This works in attributes, too. Using the static

                        <tt>AbstractConfiguration</tt> you can globally
                        define a different delimiter character or -
                        by setting the delimiter to 0 - disabling this mechanism
                        completely. Placing a backslash before a delimiter
                        character will escape it. This is demonstrated in the
                        <tt>pattern</tt> attribute of the <tt>numberFormat</tt>

</pre></div>
			<p>
				This XML is quite self explanatory; there is an arbitrary number
				of table elements, each of it has a name and a list of fields.
				A field in turn consists of a name and a data type. This
                XML document (let's call it <tt>tables.xml</tt>) can be
                loaded in exactly the same way as the simple document in the
                section before.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we now want to access some of the properties we face a
                problem: the syntax for	constructing configuration keys we
                learned so far is not powerful enough to access all of the data
                stored in the tables document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the document contains a list of tables some properties
				are defined more than once. E.g. the configuration key
				<tt>tables.table.name</tt> refers to a <tt>name</tt>
				element inside a <tt>table</tt> element inside a
				<tt>tables</tt> element. This constellation happens to
				occur twice in the tables document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Multiple definitions of a property do not cause problems and are
				supported by all classes of Configuration. If such a property
				is queried using <tt>getProperty()</tt>, the method
				recognizes that there are multiple values for that property and
				returns a collection with all these values. So we could write
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
Object prop = config.getProperty(&quot;tables.table.name&quot;);
if(prop instanceof Collection)
{
	System.out.println(&quot;Number of tables: &quot; + ((Collection&lt;?&gt;) prop).size());
}
</pre></div>
			<p>
				An alternative to this code would be the <tt>getList()</tt>
				method of <tt>Configuration</tt>. If a property is known to
				have multiple values (as is the table name property in this example),
				<tt>getList()</tt> allows retrieving all values at once.
				<b>Note:</b> it is legal to call <tt>getString()</tt>
				or one of the other getter methods on a property with multiple
				values; it returns the first element of the list.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"><h3>Accessing structured properties<a name="Accessing_structured_properties"></a></h3>
			<p>
				Okay, we can obtain a list with the names of all defined
				tables. In the same way we can retrieve a list with the names
				of all table fields: just pass the key
				<tt>tables.table.fields.field.name</tt> to the
				<tt>getList()</tt> method. In our example this list
				would contain 10 elements, the names of all fields of all tables.
				This is fine, but how do we know, which field belongs to
				which table?
			</p>
			<p>
				When working with such hierarchical structures the configuration keys
				used to query properties can have an extended syntax. All components
				of a key can be appended by a numerical value in parentheses that
				determines the index of the affected property. So if we have two
				<tt>table</tt> elements we can exactly specify, which one we
				want to address by appending the corresponding index. This is
				explained best by some examples:
			</p>
			<p>
				We will now provide some configuration keys and show the results
				of a <tt>getProperty()</tt> call with these keys as arguments.
				</p><dl>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(0).name</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns the name of the first table (all indices are 0 based),
						in this example the string <i>users</i>.
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(0)[@tableType]</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns the value of the tableType attribute of the first
						table (<i>system</i>).
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(1).name</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						Analogous to the first example returns the name of the
						second table (<i>documents</i>).
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(2).name</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						Here the name of a third table is queried, but because there
						are only two tables result is <b>null</b>. The fact that a
						<b>null</b> value is returned for invalid indices can be used
						to find out how many values are defined for a certain property:
						just increment the index in a loop as long as valid objects
						are returned.
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns a collection with the names of all fields that
						belong to the second table. With such kind of keys it is
						now possible to find out, which fields belong to which table.
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table(1).fields.field(2).name</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						The additional index after field selects a certain field.
						This expression represents the name of the third field in
						the second table (<i>creationDate</i>).
					</dd>
					<dt><tt>tables.table.fields.field(0).type</tt></dt>
					<dd>
						This key may be a bit unusual but nevertheless completely
						valid. It selects the data types of the first fields in all
						tables. So here a collection would be returned with the
						values [<i>long, long</i>].
					</dd>
				</dl>
			
			<p>
				These examples should make the usage of indices quite clear.
				Because each configuration key can contain an arbitrary number
				of indices it is possible to navigate through complex structures of
				hierarchical configurations; each property can be uniquely identified.
			</p>
            <p>
                Sometimes dealing with long property keys may become inconvenient,
                especially if always the same properties are accessed. For this
                case <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> provides a short cut
                with the <tt>configurationAt()</tt> method. This method can
                be passed a key that selects exactly one node of the hierarchy
                of nodes contained in a hierarchical configuration. Then a new
                hierarchical configuration will be returned whose root node is
                the selected node. So all property keys passed into that
                configuration should be relative to the new root node. For
                instance, if we are only interested in information about the
                first database table, we could do something like that:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
HierarchicalConfiguration sub = config.configurationAt(&quot;tables.table(0)&quot;);
String tableName = sub.getString(&quot;name&quot;);  // only need to provide relative path
List&lt;Object&gt; fieldNames = sub.getList(&quot;fields.field.name&quot;);
</pre></div>
            <p>
                For dealing with complex list-like structures there is another
                short cut. Often it will be necessary to iterate over all items
                in the list and access their (sub) properties. A good example are
                the fields of the tables in our demo configuration. When you want
                to process all fields of a table (e.g. for constructing a
                <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statement), you will need all information
                stored for them in the configuration. An option would be to use
                the <tt>getList()</tt> method to fetch the required data one
                by one:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
List&lt;Object&gt; fieldNames = config.getList(&quot;tables.table(0).fields.field.name&quot;);
List&lt;Object&gt; fieldTypes = config.getList(&quot;tables.table(0).fields.field.type&quot;);
List&lt;Object&gt; ... // further calls for other data that might be stored in the config
</pre></div>
            <p>
                But this is not very readable and will fail if not all field
                elements contain the same set of data (for instance the
                <tt>type</tt> property may be optional, then the list for
                the types can contain less elements than the other lists). A
                solution to these problems is the <tt>configurationsAt()</tt>
                method, a close relative to the <tt>configurationAt()</tt>
                method covered above. This method evaluates the passed in key and
                collects all configuration nodes that match this criterion. Then
                for each node a <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> object is
                created with this node as root node. A list with these configuration
                objects is returned. As the following example shows this comes in
                very handy when processing list-like structures:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
List&lt;HierarchicalConfiguration&gt; fields = 
    config.configurationsAt(&quot;tables.table(0).fields.field&quot;);
for(HierarchicalConfiguration sub : fields)
{
    // sub contains all data about a single field
    String fieldName = sub.getString(&quot;name&quot;);
    String fieldType = sub.getString(&quot;type&quot;);
    ...
</pre></div>
        <p>
          The configurations returned by the <tt>configurationAt()</tt> and
          <tt>configurationsAt()</tt> method are in fact instances of the
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/SubnodeConfiguration.html">
          <tt>SubnodeConfiguration</tt></a> class. The API documentation of
          this class contains more information about its features and
          limitations.

		<div class="section"><h3>Adding new properties<a name="Adding_new_properties"></a></h3>
			<p>
				So far we have learned how to use indices to avoid ambiguities when
				querying properties. The same problem occurs when adding new
				properties to a structured configuration. As an example let's
				assume we want to add a new field to the second table. New properties
				can be added to a configuration using the <tt>addProperty()</tt>
				method. Of course, we have to exactly specify where in the tree like structure new
				data is to be inserted. A statement like
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
// Warning: This might cause trouble!
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table.fields.field.name&quot;, &quot;size&quot;);
</pre></div>
			<p>
				would not be sufficient because it does not contain all needed
				information. How is such a statement processed by the
				<tt>addProperty()</tt> method?
			</p>
			<p>
				<tt>addProperty()</tt> splits the provided key into its
				single parts and navigates through the properties tree along the
				corresponding element names. In this example it will start at the
				root element and then find the <tt>tables</tt> element. The
				next key part to be processed is <tt>table</tt>, but here a
				problem occurs: the configuration contains two <tt>table</tt>
				properties below the <tt>tables</tt> element. To get rid off
				this ambiguity an index can be specified at this position in the
				key that makes clear, which of the two properties should be
				followed. <tt>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</tt> e.g.
				would select the second <tt>table</tt> property. If an index
				is missing, <tt>addProperty()</tt> always follows the last
				available element. In our example this would be the second
				<tt>table</tt>, too.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following parts of the key are processed in exactly the same
				manner. Under the selected <tt>table</tt> property there is
				exactly one <tt>fields</tt> property, so this step is not
				problematic at all. In the next step the <tt>field</tt> part
				has to be processed. At the actual position in the properties tree
				there are multiple <tt>field</tt> (sub) properties. So we here
				have the same situation as for the <tt>table</tt> part.
				Because no explicit index is defined the last <tt>field</tt>
				property is selected. The last part of the key passed to
				<tt>addProperty()</tt> (<tt>name</tt> in this example)
				will always be added as new property at the position that has
				been reached in the former processing steps. So in our example
				the last <tt>field</tt> property of the second table would
				be given a new <tt>name</tt> sub property and the resulting
				structure would look like the following listing:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
	...
    &lt;table tableType=&quot;application&quot;&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;documents&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;fields&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;docid&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;creationDate&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;authorID&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;version&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;size&lt;/name&gt;    &lt;== Newly added property
          &lt;type&gt;int&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;/fields&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/tables&gt;
&lt;/database&gt;
</pre></div>
			<p>
				This result is obviously not what was desired, but it demonstrates
				how <tt>addProperty()</tt> works: the method follows an
				existing branch in the properties tree and adds new leaves to it.
				(If the passed in key does not match a branch in the existing tree,
				a new branch will be added. E.g. if we pass the key
				<tt>tables.table.data.first.test</tt>, the existing tree can be
				navigated until the <tt>data</tt> part of the key. From here a
				new branch is started with the remaining parts <tt>data</tt>,
				<tt>first</tt> and <tt>test</tt>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If we want a different behavior, we must explicitely tell
				<tt>addProperty()</tt> what to do. In our example with the
				new field our intension was to create a new branch for the
				<tt>field</tt> part in the key, so that a new <tt>field</tt>
				property is added to the structure rather than adding sub properties
				to the last existing <tt>field</tt> property. This can be
				achieved by specifying the special index <tt>(-1)</tt> at the
				corresponding position in the key as shown below:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table(1).fields.field(-1).name&quot;, &quot;size&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table(1).fields.field.type&quot;, &quot;int&quot;);
</pre></div>
			<p>
				The first line in this fragment specifies that a new branch is
				to be created for the <tt>field</tt> property (index -1).
				In the second line no index is specified for the field, so the
				last one is used - which happens to be the field that has just
				been created. So these two statements add a fully defined field
				to the second table. This is the default pattern for adding new
				properties or whole hierarchies of properties: first create a new
				branch in the properties tree and then populate its sub properties.
				As an additional example let's add a complete new table definition
				to our example configuration:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
// Add a new table element and define the name
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table(-1).name&quot;, &quot;versions&quot;);

// Add a new field to the new table
// (an index for the table is not necessary because the latest is used)
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table.fields.field(-1).name&quot;, &quot;id&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table.fields.field.type&quot;, &quot;int&quot;);

// Add another field to the new table
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table.fields.field(-1).name&quot;, &quot;date&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables.table.fields.field.type&quot;, &quot;java.sql.Date&quot;);
...

		<div class="section"><h3>Escaping special characters<a name="Escaping_special_characters"></a></h3>
            <p>
                Some characters in property keys or values require a special
                treatment.
            </p>
			<p>
                Per default the dot character is used as delimiter by most
                configuration classes (we will learn how to change this for
                hierarchical configurations in a later section). In some
                configuration formats however, dots can be contained in the
                names of properties. For instance, in XML the dot is a legal
                character that can occur in any tag. The same is true for the names
                of properties in windows ini files. So the following XML
                document is completely valid:
			</p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;test.value&gt;42&lt;/test.value&gt;
  &lt;test.complex&gt;
    &lt;test.sub.element&gt;many dots&lt;/test.sub.element&gt;
  &lt;/test.complex&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
			<p>
                This XML document can be loaded by <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt>
                without trouble, but when we want to access certain properties
                we face a problem: The configuration claims that it does not
                store any values for the properties with the keys
                <tt>test.value</tt> or <tt>test.complex.test.sub.element</tt>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it is the dot character contained in the property
                names, which causes this problem. A dot is always interpreted
                as a delimiter between elements. So given the property key
                <tt>test.value</tt> the configuration would look for an
                element named <tt>test</tt> and then for a sub element
                with the name <tt>value</tt>. To change this behavior it is
                possible to escape a dot character, thus telling the configuration
                that it is really part of an element name. This is simply done
                by duplicating the dot. So the following statements will return
                the desired property values:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
int testVal = config.getInt(&quot;test..value&quot;);
String complex = config.getString(&quot;test..complex.test..sub..element&quot;);
</pre></div>
            <p>
                Note the duplicated dots whereever the dot does not act as
                delimiter. This way it is possible to access properties containing
                dots in arbitrary combination. However, as you can see, the
                escaping can be confusing sometimes. So if you have a choice,
                you should avoid dots in the tag names of your XML configuration
                files or other configuration sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another source of problems is related to list delimiter characters
                in the values of properties. Like other configuration classes
                <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> implements
                <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#List_handling">list handling</a>.
                This means that the values of XML elements and attributes are
                checked whether they contain a list delimiter character. If this
                is the case, the value is split, and a list property is created.
                Per default this feature is enabled. Have a look at the
                following example:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;pi&gt;3,1415&lt;/pi&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
            <p>
                Here we use the comma as delimiter for fraction digits (as is
                standard for some languages). However, the configuration will
                interpret the comma as list delimiter character and assign the
                property <i>pi</i> the two values 3 and 1415. This was not
                desired.
            </p>
            <p>
                XML has a natural way of defining list properties by simply
                repeating elements. So defining multiple values of a property in
                a single element or attribute is a rather untypical use case.
                Unfortunately, early versions of Commons Configuration had list
                delimiter splitting enabled per default. Later it became obvious
                that this feature can cause serious problems related to the
                interpretation of property values and the escaping of delimiter
                characters. For reasons of backwards compatibility we have to
                stick to this approach in the 1.x series though.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next major release the handling of lists will propably be
                reworked. Therefore it is recommended not to use this feature.
                You are save if you disable it immediately after the creation of
                an <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> object (and before a file is
                loaded). This can be achieved as follows:
            </p>
   			<div class="source"><pre>
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
config.setDelimiterParsingDisabled(true);
config.setAttributeSplittingDisabled(true);
config.load(&quot;config.xml&quot;);
</pre></div>
        </div>
	</div>

    <div class="section"><h2>Expression engines<a name="Expression_engines"></a></h2>
        <p>
            In the previous chapters we saw many examples about how properties
            in a <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> object (or more general in a
            <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> object, because this is the
            base class, which implements this functionality) can be queried or
            modified using a special syntax for the property keys. Well, this
            was not the full truth. Actually, property keys are not processed
            by the configuration object itself, but are delegated to a helper
            object, a so called <i>Expression engine</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The separation of the task of interpreting property keys into a
            helper object is a typical application of the <i>Strategy</i>
            design pattern. In this case it also has the advantage that it
            becomes possible to plug in different expression engines into a
            <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> object. So by providing
            different implementations of the
            <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/tree/ExpressionEngine.html">
            <tt>ExpressionEngine</tt></a>
            interface hierarchical configurations can support alternative
            expression languages for accessing their data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we discuss the available expression engines that ship
            with Commons Configuration, it should be explained how an
            expression engine can be associated with a configuration object.
            <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
            <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt></a> and all derived classes
            provide a <tt>setExpressionEngine()</tt> method, which expects
            an implementation of the <tt>ExpressionEngine</tt> interface as
            argument. After this method was called, the configuration object will
            use the passed expression engine, which means that all property keys
            passed to methods like <tt>getProperty()</tt>,
            <tt>getString()</tt>, or <tt>addProperty()</tt> must
            conform to the syntax supported by this engine. Property keys
            returned by the <tt>getKeys()</tt> method will follow this
            syntax, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to instance specific expression engines that change the
            behavior of single configuration objects it is also possible to set
            a global expression engine. This engine is shared between all
            hierarchical configuration objects, for which no specific expression
            engine was set. The global expression engine can be set using the
            static <tt>setDefaultExpressionEngine()</tt> method of
            <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt>. By invoking this method with
            a custom expression engine the syntax of all hierarchical configuration
            objects can be altered at once.
        </p>
        
        <div class="section"><h3>The default expression engine<a name="The_default_expression_engine"></a></h3>
            <p>
                The syntax described so far for property keys of hierarchical
                configurations is implemented by a specific implementation of the
                <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/tree/ExpressionEngine.html">
                <tt>ExpressionEngine</tt></a> interface called
                <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/tree/DefaultExpressionEngine.html">
                <tt>DefaultExpressionEngine</tt></a>. An instance of this class
                is installed as the global expression engine in
                <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt>. So all newly created
                instances of this class will make use of this engine (which is
                the reason that our examples above worked).
            </p>
            <p>
                After reading the examples of property keys provided so far in
                this document you should have a sound understanding regarding
                the features and the syntax supported by the
                <tt>DefaultExpressionEngine</tt> class. But it can do a
                little bit more for you: it defines a bunch of properties,
                which can be used to customize most tokens that can appear in a
                valid property key. You prefer curly brackets over paranthesis
                as index markers? You find the duplicated dot as escaped
                property delimiter counter-intuitive? Well, simply go ahead and
                change it! The following example shows how the syntax of a
                <tt>DefaultExpressionEngine</tt> object is modified. Then
                this object is set as the global expression engine, so that from
                now on all hierarchical configuration objects will take up this
                new syntax:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultExpressionEngine engine = new DefaultExpressionEngine();

// Use a slash as property delimiter
engine.setPropertyDelimiter(&quot;/&quot;);
// Indices should be provided in curly brackets
engine.setIndexStart(&quot;{&quot;);
engine.setIndexEnd(&quot;}&quot;);
// For attributes use simply a @
engine.setAttributeStart(&quot;@&quot;);
engine.setAttributeEnd(null);
// A Backslash is used for escaping property delimiters
engine.setEscapedDelimiter(&quot;\\/&quot;);

// Now install this engine as the global engine
HierarchicalConfiguration.setDefaultExpressionEngine(engine);

// Access properties using the new syntax
HierarchicalConfiguration config = ...
String tableName = config.getString(&quot;tables/table{0}/name&quot;);
String tableType = config.getString(&quot;tables/table{0}@type&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                <i>Tip:</i> Sometimes when processing an XML document you
                don't want to distinguish between attributes and &quot;normal&quot;
                child nodes. You can achieve this by setting the
                <tt>AttributeEnd</tt> property to <b>null</b> and the
                <tt>AttributeStart</tt> property to the same value as the
                <tt>PropertyDelimiter</tt> property. Then the syntax for
                accessing attributes is the same as the syntax for other
                properties:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
DefaultExpressionEngine engine = new DefaultExpressionEngine();
engine.setAttributeEnd(null);
engine.setAttributeStart(engine.getPropertyDelimiter());
...
Object value = config.getProperty(&quot;tables.table(0).name&quot;);
// name can either be a child node of table or an attribute
         </pre></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section"><h3>The XPATH expression engine<a name="The_XPATH_expression_engine"></a></h3>
            <p>
                The expression language provided by the <tt>DefaultExpressionEngine</tt>
                class is powerful enough to address all properties in a
                hierarchical configuration, but it is not always convenient to
                use. Especially if list structures are involved, it is often
                necessary to iterate through the whole list to find a certain
                element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about our example configuration that stores information about
                database tables. A use case could be to load all fields that belong
                to the &quot;users&quot; table. If you knew the index of this
                table, you could simply build a property key like
                <tt>tables.table(&lt;index&gt;).fields.field.name</tt>,
                but how do you find out the correct index? When using the
                default expression engine, the only solution to this problem is
                to iterate over all tables until you find the &quot;users&quot;
                table.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life would be much easier if an expression language could be used,
                which would directly support queries of such kind. In the XML
                world, the XPATH syntax has grown popular as a powerful means
                of querying structured data. In XPATH a query that selects all
                field names of the &quot;users&quot; table would look something
                like <tt>tables/table[@name='users']/fields/name</tt> (here
                we assume that the table's name is modelled as an attribute).
                This is not only much simpler than an iteration over all tables,
                but also much more readable: it is quite obvious, which fields
                are selected by this query.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the power of XPATH it is no wonder that we got many
                user requests to add XPATH support to Commons Configuration.
                Well, here is it!
            </p>
            <p>
                For enabling XPATH syntax for property keys you need the
                <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/tree/xpath/XPathExpressionEngine.html">
                <tt>XPathExpressionEngine</tt></a> class. This class
                implements the <tt>ExpressionEngine</tt> interface and can
                be plugged into a <tt>HierarchicalConfiguration</tt> object
                using the <tt>setExpressionEngine()</tt> method. It is also
                possible to set an instance of this class as the global
                expression engine, so that all hierarchical configuration
                objects make use of XPATH syntax. The following code fragment
                shows how XPATH support can be enabled for a configuration
                object:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
HierarchicalConfiguration config = ...
config.setExpressionEngine(new XPathExpressionEngine());

// Now we can use XPATH queries:
List&lt;Object&gt; fields = config.getList(&quot;tables/table[1]/fields/name&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                XPATH expressions are not only used for selecting properties
                (i.e. for the several getter methods), but also for adding new
                properties. For this purpose the keys passed into the
                <tt>addProperty()</tt> method must conform to a special
                syntax. They consist of two parts: the first part is an
                arbitrary XPATH expression that selects the node where the new
                property is to be added to, the second part defines the new
                element to be added. Both parts are separated by whitespace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, let's make an example. Say, we want to add a <tt>type</tt>
                property under the first table (as a sibling to the <tt>name</tt>
                element). Then the first part of our key will have to select
                the first table element, the second part will simply be
                <tt>type</tt>, i.e. the name of the new property:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[1] type&quot;, &quot;system&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                (Note that indices in XPATH are 1-based, while in the default
                expression language they are 0-based.) In this example the part
                <tt>tables/table[1]</tt> selects the target element of the
                add operation. This element must exist and must be unique, otherwise an exception
                will be thrown. <tt>type</tt> is the name of the new element
                that will be added. If instead of a normal element an attribute
                should be added, the example becomes
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[1] @type&quot;, &quot;system&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                It is possible to add complete paths at once. Then the single
                elements in the new path are separated by &quot;/&quot;
                characters. The following example shows how data about a new
                table can be added to the configuration. Here we use full paths:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
// Add new table &quot;tasks&quot; with name element and type attribute
config.addProperty(&quot;tables table/name&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot;);
// last() selects the last element of this name,
// which is the newest table element
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[last()] @type&quot;, &quot;system&quot;);

// Now add fields
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[last()] fields/field/name&quot;, &quot;taskid&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[last()]/fields/field[last()] type&quot;, &quot;int&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[last()]/fields field/name&quot;, &quot;name&quot;);
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table[last()]/fields field/name&quot;, &quot;startDate&quot;);
...
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                The first line of this example adds the path <tt>table/name</tt>
                to the <tt>tables</tt> element, i.e. a new <tt>table</tt>
                element will be created and added as last child to the
                <tt>tables</tt> element. Then a new <tt>name</tt> element
                is added as child to the new <tt>table</tt> element. To this
                element the value &quot;tasks&quot; is assigned. The next line
                adds a <tt>type</tt> attribute to the new table element. To
                obtain the correct <tt>table</tt> element, to which the
                attribute must be added, the XPATH function <tt>last()</tt>
                is used; this function selects the last element with a given
                name, which in this case is the new <tt>table</tt> element.
                The following lines all use the same approach to construct a new
                element hierarchy: At first complete new branches are added
                (<tt>fields/field/name</tt>), then to the newly created
                elements further children are added.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is one gotcha with these keys described so far: they do
                not work with the <tt>setProperty()</tt> method! This is
                because <tt>setProperty()</tt> has to check whether the
                passed in key already exists; therefore it needs a key which can
                be interpreted by query methods. If you want to use
                <tt>setProperty()</tt>, you can pass in regular keys (i.e.
                without a whitespace separator). The method then tries to figure
                out which part of the key already exists in the configuration
                and adds new nodes as necessary. In principle such regular keys
                can also be used with <tt>addProperty()</tt>. However, they
                do not contain sufficient information to decide where new nodes
                should be added.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make this clearer let's go back to the example with the
                tables. Consider that there is a configuration which already
                contains information about some database tables. In order to add
                a new table element in the configuration
                <tt>addProperty()</tt> could be used as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
config.addProperty(&quot;tables/table/name&quot;, &quot;documents&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                In the configuration a <tt>&lt;tables&gt;</tt> element
                already exists, also <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> and
                <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> elements. How should the expression
                engine know where new node structures are to be added? The
                solution to this problem is to provide this information in the
                key by stating:
            </p>
            <div class="source"><pre>
config.addProperty(&quot;tables table/name&quot;, &quot;documents&quot;);
         </pre></div>
            <p>
                Now it is clear that new nodes should be added as children of
                the  <tt>&lt;tables&gt;</tt> element. More information about
                keys and how they play together with <tt>addProperty()</tt>
                and <tt>setProperty()</tt> can be found in the Javadocs for
                <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/tree/xpath/XPathExpressionEngine.html">

                It is important to mention that by embedding Commons JXPath the
                full extent of the XPATH 1.0 standard can be used for constructing

    <div class="section"><h2>Validation of XML configuration files<a name="Validation_of_XML_configuration_files"></a></h2>
        <p>
            XML parsers provide support for validation of XML documents to ensure that they
            conform to a certain DTD or XML Schema. This feature can be useful for
            configuration files, too. <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> allows this feature
            to be enabled when files are loaded.
        </p>
        <div class="section"><h3>Validation using a DTD<a name="Validation_using_a_DTD"></a></h3>
        <p>
            The easiest way to turn on validation is to simply set the
            <tt>validating</tt> property to true as shown in the
            following example:
        </p>
        <div class="source"><pre>
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
config.setFileName(&quot;myconfig.xml&quot;);
config.setValidating(true);

// This will throw a ConfigurationException if the XML document does not
// conform to its DTD.
config.load();
</pre></div>
        <p>
            Setting the <tt>validating</tt> flag to true will cause
            <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> to use a validating XML parser. At this parser
            a custom <tt>ErrorHandler</tt> will be registered, which throws
            exceptions on simple and fatal parsing errors.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><h3>Validation using a Schema<a name="Validation_using_a_Schema"></a></h3>
        <p>
            XML Parsers also provide support for validating XML documents using an
            XML Schema. XMLConfiguration provides a simple mechanism for enabling
            this by setting the <tt>schemaValidation</tt> flag to true. This
            will also set the <tt>validating</tt> flag to true so both do not
            need to be set. The XML Parser will then use the schema defined in the
            XML document to validate it. Enabling schema validation will also
            enable the parser's namespace support.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p><div class="source"><pre>
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
config.setFileName(&quot;myconfig.xml&quot;);
config.setSchemaValidation(true);

// This will throw a ConfigurationException if the XML document does not
// conform to its Schema.
config.load();
</pre></div>
        
        </div>
        <div class="section"><h3>Default Entity Resolution<a name="Default_Entity_Resolution"></a></h3>
        <p>
            There is also some support for dealing with DTD files. Often the
            DTD of an XML document is stored locally so that it can be quickly
            accessed. However the <tt>DOCTYPE</tt> declaration of the document
            points to a location on the web as in the following example:
        </p>
        <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app
  PUBLIC &quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2.2.dtd&quot;&gt;
</pre></div>
        <p>
            When working with XML documents directly you would use an
            <tt>EntityResolver</tt> in such a case. The task of such an
            entity resolver is to point the XML parser to the location of the
            file referred to by the declaration. So in our example the entity
            resolver would load the DTD file from a local cache instead of
            retrieving it from the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> provides a simple default implementation of
            an <tt>EntityResolver</tt>. This implementation is initialized
            by calling the <tt>registerEntityId()</tt> method with the
            public IDs of the entities to be retrieved and their corresponding
            local URLs. This method has to be called before the configuration
            is loaded. To continue our example, consider that the DTD file for
            our example document is stored on the class path. We can register it
            at <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> using the following code:
        </p>
        <div class="source"><pre>
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
// load the URL to the DTD file from class path
URL dtdURL = getClass().getResource(&quot;web-app_2.2.dtd&quot;);
// register it at the configuration
config.registerEntityId(&quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.2//EN&quot;,
    dtdURL);
config.setValidating(true);  // enable validation
config.setFileName(&quot;web.xml&quot;);
config.load();
</pre></div>
        <p>
            This basically tells the XML configuration to use the specified
            URL when it encounters the given public ID. Note that the call to
            <tt>registerEntityId()</tt> has to be performed before the
            configuration is loaded. So you cannot use one of the constructors
            that directly load the configuration.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><h3>Enhanced Entity Resolution<a name="Enhanced_Entity_Resolution"></a></h3>
        <p>
            While the default entity resolver can be used under certain circumstances,
            it does not work well when using the DefaultConfigurationBuilder.
            Furthermore, in many circumstances the programmatic nature of
            registering entities will tie the application tightly to the
            XML content. In addition, because it only works with the public id it
            cannot support XML documents using an XML Schema.
        </p>

            <a class="externalLink" href="http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html#s.whats.wrong">XML
            Entity and URI Resolvers</a> describes using a set of catalog files to
            resolve enitities. Commons Configuration provides support for
            this Catalog Resolver through its own CatalogResolver class.
        </p>
         <div class="source"><pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Employees xmlns=&quot;http://commons.apache.org/employee&quot;
           xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
           xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://commons.apache.org/employee http://commons.apache.org/sample.xsd&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Employee&gt;
    &lt;SSN&gt;555121211&lt;/SSN&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;John Doe&lt;/Name&gt;
    &lt;DateOfBirth&gt;1975-05-15&lt;/DateOfBirth&gt;
    &lt;EmployeeType&gt;Exempt&lt;/EmployeeType&gt;
    &lt;Salary&gt;100000&lt;/Salary&gt;
  &lt;/Employee&gt;
&lt;/Employees&gt;</pre></div>
        <p>
            The XML sample above is an XML document using a default namespace of
            http://commons.apache.org/employee. The schemaLocation allows a set
            of namespaces and hints to the location of their corresponding
            schemas. When processing the document the parser will pass the hint,
            in this case http://commons.apache.org/sample.xsd, to the entity resolver
            as the system id. More information on using schema locations can be found
            at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/#schemaLocation">schemaLocation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example that follows shows how to use the CatalogResolver when
            processing an XMLConfiguration. It should be noted that by using the
            setEntityResolver method any EntityResolver may be used, not just those
            provided by Commons Configuration.
        </p>
        <div class="source"><pre>
CatalogResolver resolver = new CatalogResolver();
resolver.setCatalogFiles(&quot;local/catalog.xml&quot;,&quot;http://test.org/catalogs/catalog1.xml&quot;);
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
config.setEntityResolver(resolver);
config.setSchemaValidation(true);  // enable schema validation
config.setFileName(&quot;config.xml&quot;);
config.load();
</pre></div>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><h3>Extending Validation and Entity Resolution<a name="Extending_Validation_and_Entity_Resolution"></a></h3>
        <p>
            The mechanisms provided with Commons Configuration will hopefully be
            sufficient in most cases, however there will certainly be circumstances
            where they are not. XMLConfiguration provides two extension mechanisms
            that should provide applications with all the flexibility they may
            need. The first, registering a custom Entity Resolver has already been
            discussed in the preceeding section. The second is that XMLConfiguration
            provides a generic way of setting up the XML parser to use: A preconfigured
            <tt>DocumentBuilder</tt> object can be passed to the
            <tt>setDocumentBuilder()</tt> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            So an application can create a <tt>DocumentBuilder</tt> object
            and initialize it according to its special needs. Then this
            object must be passed to the <tt>XMLConfiguration</tt> instance
            before invocation of the <tt>load()</tt> method. When loading
            a configuration file, the passed in <tt>DocumentBuilder</tt> will
            be used instead of the default one. <i>Note:</i> If a custom
            <tt>DocumentBuilder</tt> is used, the default implementation of
            the <tt>EntityResolver</tt> interface is disabled. This means
            that the <tt>registerEntityId()</tt> method has no effect in
            this mode.
